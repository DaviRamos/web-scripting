# web-scripting
   
   Web-scripting programs to extract various data from different websites having traditional HTML+CSS base and Javascript. 

   The code is executed on Turkish websites. Yet, it is easy to understand. All of the programs are based on Beautifulsoup and some of them also use Selenium.You need to install chromedriver for Selenium. There is a lack of information about web-scripting in advance levels. I hope everyone can use those programs as guidelines. Almost all of the code is written rapidly so unprofessionally. If you are motivated to contribute, we can make this repo a proffessional one. 
   
   The order below is from beginner to advanced for me:
   
   1. sporx.py
   2. iddaa.py
   3. mynet.py
   4. goal.py
   5. sabah.py
   6. mackolik_maclar_ve_iddaa_oranlarÄ±.py
   7. econExp.py
   
   
 Don't hesitate to bother for this messy repo!
